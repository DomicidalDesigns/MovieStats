This web app has three main components. 

The **Statistics and Rankings** page has two tabs. The **Visualizations** tab displays some visualizations on the distribution
of ratings of all movies from the data sources. Different plots are created for three rating systems: IMDb rating, Metascore from
Metacritics and Tomatometer from Rotten Tomatoes. The **Director/Actor Rankings** tab shows top actors and directors based on their
average movie ratings. The three rating systems are also available for these rankings. On the left side of this page is a few filtering
criteria determining which movies, actors or directors to be included in the output.

The **Directors** page contains general information and statistics of over 10,000 directors. You can find a director by type in and select
his/her name in the search box right under the "Directors" tab in the side menu. The **Actors** page functions in the exact same way,
only that it displays information of individual actors.

Note that at the moment, some of the pages can take a little while to render. So you might want to wait a moment before jumping to another
page. I will keep optimizing my codes to make sure the data processing is as fast as possible.
