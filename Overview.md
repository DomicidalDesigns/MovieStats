Aside from this page, this web app has four main components. 

The **Statistics and Rankings** page has two tabs. The **Visualizations** tab displays some visualizations on the distribution
of ratings of all movies from the data sources. Different plots are created for three rating systems: IMDb rating, Metascore from
Metacritics and Tomatometer from Rotten Tomatoes. The **Director/Actor Rankings** tab shows top actors and directors based on their
average movie ratings. The three rating systems are also available for these rankings. On the left side of this page is a few filtering
criteria determining which movies, actors or directors to be included in the output.

The **Directors** page contains general information and statistics of over 10,000 directors. You can find a director by type in and select
his/her name in the search box right under the "Directors" tab in the side menu. Make sure you click on the tab to see the results as the search
box doesn't automatically direct you there. The **Actors** page functions in the exact same way, only that it displays information of individual actors.

The **Fun Facts** page showcases some of the interesting facts buried beneath the data. Currently it covers topics like Oscar's award records and
polarizing movies. More items will be added further down the line.

Most plots and tables in these pages are interactive. Interactive plots are powered by Plotly. Hover your mouse over the plots to see additional
information as well as possible actions like zooming in. Interactive tables are powered by jQuery DataTable library. Filter options can be applied
to the table through search boxes. You can also sort the tables by columns. 

Note that at the moment, some of the pages can take a little while to render. So you might want to wait a moment before jumping to another
page. I will keep optimizing my codes to make sure the data processing is as fast as possible.
